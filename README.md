puppyPals

puppyPals is an app for dog owners who wish to help their dogs find friends in their neighborhood.

It works as follows:
- The dog owner creates a profile for their dog
- They can search for other dogs by their age, sex, size and zip code
- They can click on a dog on the search results page to get detailed information relating to that dog and their owner
- They can email the other dog owner directly

The following technologies were used:
- React
- Sequelize and MySQL
- Cloudinary to store image APIâ€™s (Cloudinary is an image hosting service)
- Heroku
- Dog API for dog facts as a service
- CSS/Bootstrap

Future enhancements:
- Integrate Google Maps to show locations of other dogs, or to look for nearby parks, etc.
- Add a feature that shows which pet owners also pet sit
- Offer a "Favorites" list
- Add instant messaging
- Add "Sort by" feature on Search Results page
